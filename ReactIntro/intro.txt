React is js library

Benefits :

i. Fast: bcz in genral html, css,js code, everytime a small change in code happens
   it will create the DOM again, so loading time will be more
   But in react,when a small change in code happens, then its algo called as Diffing
   Algo will identify the change, and send it to to Virtual DOM which make the 
   changes and creates a new DOM. 

ii. Easy Event Handling
